<h1 align="center">WARNING⚠️</h1>
<P>
   It has come to my attention that there is a <bold>infected clone</bold> of our multitool. After further anaylsis, it is obfuscated lua malware. I do NOT recommend running it as it may be a rat, stealer, or ransomware. Please note that you are getting our multitool from <a href="https://github.com/sigmachipmunk/Azora-Multitool/">here</a> as this is the offical repository

   On the other hand, make sure that you NEVER download it from <a href="https://github.com/roindroid/Azora-Multitool">here</a>. I unfortunately not quick and this has been going on for around a month. It is still active as it has updated 15 minutes ago. To conclude this warning, there is an infected clone and you should not download it.
